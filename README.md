- 👋 Hi, I’m @rfpaul
- 👀 I’m interested in finding insight from data, in whatever form or method it takes.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my existing skill set in machine learning and data management.
- 💞️ I'm potentially open to collaborate on geospatial data and analysis, data viz, and image processing.
- 📫 Message me here or find an active email from somewhere (it's not hard).
