- 👋 Hi, I’m @rfpaul
- 👀 I’m interested in finding insight from data, in whatever form or method it takes.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my existing skill set in machine learning/AI and data engineering.
- 💞️ I'm open to opportunities involving geospatial/spatiotemporal data and analysis, ag tech, climate tech, data viz, and image processing.
- 📫 Message me here, on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-paul-653bba240/), or seek out an active email from somewhere.
