- 👋 Hi, I’m @rfpaul
- 👀 I’m interested in finding insight from data, in whatever form or method it takes.

- 💞️ I'm open to opportunities involving geospatial/spatiotemporal data and analysis, ag tech, climate tech, data viz, and image processing.
- 📫 Message me here or find an active email from somewhere.
